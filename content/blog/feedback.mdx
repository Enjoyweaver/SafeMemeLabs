We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new feedback and feature request page on our app. This platform is designed to help us grow together with our community by understanding your wants and needs as we work towards creating a secure and thriving safe meme economy.

## Why We Created the Feedback Page

At SafeMeme Labs, we believe that the best way to grow is by listening to our community. We created this feedback page to understand your desires and expectations, and to keep you informed about our progress and upcoming features.

### Importance of Constructive Feedback

One of the most important aspects of this feedback page is the value we place on constructive feedback. Constructive feedback doesn't mean praising us or our appâ€”it means providing input that helps us improve, even if it's critical. We understand that growth comes from recognizing our weaknesses and addressing them, and we are committed to this process.

For our initial development phase, we are looking to reward 21 contributors for their submitted feedback. As a token of our appreciation, all contributors who submit accepted feedback will receive an equal share of the reward bounty.

### Rewards for Your Contribution

We want to reward those who take the time to provide constructive feedback or suggest new features that are approved. Users who connect their wallet and provide feedback or feature requests that are approved will receive rewards. These rewards are our way of showing appreciation for your valuable contributions.

### Linking Wallet Addresses to Profiles

To further recognize our contributors, we will link the wallet addresses of those who provide constructive feedback or suggest approved features to their profile pages. This allows the community to see the rewards you have received and acknowledges your contributions to the SafeMeme Labs ecosystem.

## Our To-Do List

We are continuously working on improving our platform. Here are a few examples of what we are currently focusing on:

- Improving the user profile page URL to reference wallet addresses
- Displaying users' earnings, their received dates, and their current worth on profile pages
- Showing the volume and trade activity of tokens listed on users' profile pages

## Join Us in Building a Safe Meme Economy

Your feedback and suggestions are crucial for us to create a better and safer meme economy.

Thank you for being a part of the SafeMeme Labs community. We look forward to growing and improving with your help!
