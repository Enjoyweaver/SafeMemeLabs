#NOT YET RELEASED ANNOUNCEMENT

We're excited to announce a new feature on our app that will empower users to create their own "frames" on Farcaster and deploy them directly from our platform. This initiative is part of our ongoing commitment to foster creativity and community engagement within the SafeMeme Labs ecosystem.

## Why We Are Introducing User-Created Frames

At SafeMeme Labs, we believe in the power of community-driven content. By allowing users to create and deploy their own frames on Farcaster, we aim to provide a new avenue for expression and engagement. This feature will enable users to showcase their creativity, share unique designs, and contribute to the vibrant meme economy.

### Importance of User-Generated Content

User-generated content is a cornerstone of a thriving digital community. It allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives, fostering a richer and more inclusive environment. By introducing the ability to create frames, we are not only enhancing the user experience but also building a more dynamic and participatory platform.

### Rewards for Your Creativity

To celebrate the launch of this feature, we will be rewarding users who create and deploy their own frames. Users who connect their wallet and successfully deploy a frame from our app will receive special rewards. These rewards are our way of acknowledging and appreciating your creative contributions.

### Linking Wallet Addresses to Frames

To ensure that creators are properly recognized, we will link the wallet addresses of those who create and deploy frames to their profile pages. This allows the community to see the frames you have created and acknowledges your contributions to the SafeMeme Labs ecosystem.

## Our To-Do List

We are continuously working on enhancing our platform. Here are a few examples of what we are currently focusing on:

- Improving the frame creation tool to offer more customization options
- Integrating analytics to track the performance and popularity of user-created frames
- Enhancing the deployment process to make it seamless and user-friendly

## Join Us in Building a Creative Community

Your creativity and participation are crucial for us to create a more engaging and vibrant meme economy.

Thank you for being a part of the SafeMeme Labs community. We look forward to seeing the amazing frames you will create and deploy!
