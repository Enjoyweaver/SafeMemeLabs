<Callout>What is a safe meme econonmy?</Callout>

Our goal is to create a safe meme ecosystem that is self-supportive and perptually sustainable for its participants.
For us, this means having a clear path to onboard users, banking, scalability, and waste recyling efficiency.
We want to create a structure that supports its long-term users while rewarding new-comers sustainably and in
a scalable manner. However, we are limited in how we can scale because we do not mint new tokens as new users on-board.

### DeFi Education + Guides

Not everyone understands defi, how to create tokens, or even how to purchase them, but those shouldnt be hurdles for new
users to participate. That's why we will create guide's to help new users navigate defi smoothly.

### Safely purchasing memes
