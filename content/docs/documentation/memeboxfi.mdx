We created 21,000,000,000 $bubbles using MemeBoxFi which was the smoothest experience. The $bubbles contract address
is: 0x54B051d102c19c1Cc12a391b0eefCD7eeb64CeDA

The token creation information can be found here: https://ftmscan.com/tx/0xa955aa716b095e11f94808c58f97aa28bc00bc8c62c96820e0d29b7b4767c9f8

MemeBoxFi was fun to use, not gimmicky, and straightforward to its mission of helping me launch my own meme, highly recommended.

There is going to be much more to come from $bubbles, and although this story is short for now, it will lead to a long road of success
for those who read it:

"The first one-hundred wallets that hold without selling will be whitelisted
for whats next."
