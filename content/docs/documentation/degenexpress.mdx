description: Our $safememe deployed using Degen.Express
---

Our first token launched using a competitor was using Degen.Express where we created the
$safememe token with the contract address: 0x14E3C9107b16AF020E4F2B5971CC19C6DFc8F15B

The way Degen.Express works is by allowing users to buy tokens in a "pre-sale" phase similar to a
fair-launch. Once the marketcap reaches $75,000 then the tokens will deployed to a DEX though
$12,000 worth of the liquidity will be burned, or we think, we hope they explain more.

The website to purchase the token is:
https://degen.express/fantom/token/0x14E3C9107b16AF020E4F2B5971CC19C6DFc8F15B

- Total supply: 1,000,000,00
