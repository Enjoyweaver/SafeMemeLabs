  Michael saw the need for regulatory clarity while he was
  starting a Web3 insurance company called inDemniFi. In order to write 
  the policies and design the financials, there needed to be an existing regulatory or
  financial framework to work with. Finding no such framework, he was motivated to work
  on it himself. He founded Crypto Policy DAO in order collaborate with others
  to draft and implement web3-friendly regulation.

  Michael has a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and an MBA in data
  analytics from the University of South Carolina. Professionally he has been in 
  insurance since 2014, starting as a Captive Insurance Producer. In his first year
  he had an insurance portfolio over $1.2 million and was enamored by the depths
  of captive insurance. Soon after, he started advising clients on their enterprise risk 
  ranging from operational, financial, and hazard risk. Luckily for him, this coverered fields 
  such as financial reinvestment, employee stock owned programs, first and third-party contractual law,
  vendor liability, product liability, and even business continuity and gave him a strong foundation
  of knowledge and experience when he started his underwriting and enterprise risk 
  managenent professional designations, which are listed below:

- Certified Insurance Counselor (CIC)
- Associate Risk Manager (ARM)
- Certified Risk Manager (CRM)

  Michael was bit by the crypto bug in early 2020 and hasn't turned back since.
  Even though his own brother was mining bitcoin in 2011, it's hard to believe he
  waited to dive in to crypto for nearly 10 years. Now creating insurance and
  regulatory models for Web3 are his motivations and passions.

  Fortunately for Michael, he had the experience to create the
  Public Policy Think Tank for ATX DAO, one of the most promising and impactful 
  DAOs. In the beginning of ATX DAO, the Public Policy Think Tank was only
  one of many departments and over time it has become a third
  of ATX DAO's purpose, and they have had much success. Based on the
  founding principles established by Michael, ATX DAO has gone on to advise the state of
  Texas on the creation of its first DAO Law - "What is a DAO?"

Learning and improving upon the knowledge and experience gained during his time as
 a member of ATX DAO, Michael has left the ATX DAO to create Crypto Policy DAO to focus 
 more on Web3 regulation and legislation.
